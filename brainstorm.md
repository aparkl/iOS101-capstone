# **iOS App Ideas**

**1. TODO Time Tracker**
    A simple todo app but with a feature to track how much time the user spends on each task with a simple habit analysis tool.
    
**2. Expense Tracker**
    A simple app for tracking earnings and expenses and managing budget and savings for specific periods with some automated recommendation tools
    
**3. Leaderboard to Boost Competition**
    A full-stack app to promote healthy competitions by allowing users to create a contest of any form for people to compete against each other, whether it's how many miles they run a week, class attendance, etc.


## **No. 1 - TODO Time Tracker**

### Mobile

- While the app doesn't strictly require exclusive mobile features, building it as a mobile app makes more sense than a web-based version.
- A to-do app needs to be easily accessible throughout the day, which mobile naturally supports.
- Push notifications for task reminders or focus session nudges are highly relevant and add real value on mobile.
- Mobile availability aligns with how users typically engage with task management tools—quick check-ins, edits, and timers on-the-go.

### Story

- The app idea may not be groundbreaking on the surface, but its value lies in personal relevance and depth of execution.
- As someone who has struggled with time management and productivity, the motivation behind building this app is authentic and relatable.
- The MVP will likely resemble a reminder app combined with stopwatch functionality.
- However, with planned feature expansion into data analytics and productivity insights, it has potential to evolve into a tool that genuinely helps users understand and improve their time usage.
- The story becomes compelling when framed as a personal solution turned into a useful tool for others with similar struggles.


### Market

- **Large user base**: Productivity and time management apps serve millions of users (e.g., Todoist, Toggl, Notion).
- **Valuable to a niche**: Especially helpful for freelancers, students, productivity-focused users, and people with ADHD or time-blindness.
- **Cross-category appeal**: Combines task management, time tracking, and habit analytics — few apps execute all three effectively.
- **Well-defined audience**: Designed for people who want to understand how they spend their time, not just complete tasks.

### Habit

- **High engagement potential**: Users may engage multiple times per day to manage tasks, run timers, and review progress.
- **User-generated activity**: The core experience is interactive—users create tasks, initiate timers, and log sessions, increasing stickiness.
- **Habit-forming design**: Features like daily streaks, weekly summaries, and progress visualizations provide consistent motivation to return.
- **Expandable for retention**: Additional features like lock screen widgets, push reminders, and intelligent nudges can further encourage daily usage.


### Scope

- The core concept is clearly defined—build a to-do list app with stopwatch-based time tracking for each task.
- The MVP is technically manageable within a program timeline. It involves standard full-stack components: task CRUD, timer functionality, authentication, and a basic data visualization layer.
- Even a minimal version (to-do list + per-task timers + basic tracking) is meaningful and interesting to build. It covers real-world use cases and showcases both frontend interaction and backend logic.
- The product vision is focused and extensible. The first milestone is a functional, usable daily productivity app. Later stages (e.g., insights, behavioral analytics, and smart nudges) are optional but well-aligned with the core mission.

## Leaderboard

### Market

- **Broad appeal**: Applies to fitness enthusiasts, students, remote teams, and social groups looking for accountability or motivation.
- **Niche value**: Especially valuable for groups that already engage in challenges informally (e.g., workout groups, classmates, online communities).
- **Defined audience**: Target users include accountability partners, coaches, teachers, productivity groups, and casual friend circles.

### Habit

- **Repeatable use**: Users will return daily or weekly to log progress, view leaderboards, or adjust goals.
- **User-generated engagement**: Users actively create and participate in challenges, upload progress, and interact with others.
- **Social stickiness**: Friendly competition and shared goals increase motivation and habit formation through peer accountability.

### Mobile

- **Highly mobile-friendly**: Users will likely log quick stats, check leaderboards, or get reminders on the go.
- **Push notifications**: Useful for nudges like “You’re falling behind in your challenge” or “X just logged new progress.”

### Story

- The app supports a socially driven productivity tool, helping users stay motivated by leveraging group dynamics.
- The story resonates with anyone who thrives with structure, goals, and a bit of friendly pressure.
- MVP could be as simple as: create challenge → invite friends → track scores manually.
- The long-term vision includes integrations with fitness trackers, study timers, or external APIs for automatic data pulls.

### Scope

- User auth, challenge creation, progress tracking, and basic leaderboards are all achievable within a typical program timeline.
- Even a simple version with manual score logging is engaging and interactive.
- Social feeds, gamification, badges, and automated data syncing are natural future iterations.
- The core concept is focused and flexible, supporting many real-world use cases with one solid model.

## Final Decision

I choose **TODO Time Tracker** for the final app idea since implementing its MVP is more do-able than the competition booster app, in a short time frame.
